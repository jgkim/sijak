# Sijak

Sijak (시작 &mdash; 始作) is a Sino-Korean word meaning 'to begin to do,' and there is a saying in Korea that "시작이 반이다," which means well begun is half done. To help you begin well, this repository provides a stepping stone (or boilerplate) for building universal JavaScript applications using the following technologies:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) &mdash; an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment
- [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm/) &mdash; a Node.js version manager
- [yarn](http://yarnpkg.com/) &mdash; an open source JavaScript package manager
