Sijak (시작 &mdash; 始作) is a Sino-Korean word meaning 'to begin to do,' and there is a saying in Korea that "시작이 반이다," which means well begun is half done.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) &mdash; an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment
- [yarn](http://yarnpkg.com/) &mdash; an open source JavaScript package manager
- [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm/) &mdash; a Node.js version manager
- [Babel](http://babeljs.io/) &mdash; a JavaScript transpiler
- [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) with [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/) &mdash; a pluggable and configurable JavaScript linter
